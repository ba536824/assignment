drbd-promote@.service(7)
========================

Name
----
drbd-promote@.service - System unit to promote a specific DRBD resource

Synopsis
--------
**drbd-promote@**__RESNAME__**.service**

Description
-----------
Usually you do not want to "hardcode" an unconditional promotion attempt of
DRBD resources, because you usually cannot know a-priory whether this instance
of DRBD will have access to good data (yet).

So this is intended to be used for conditional promotion, for example using *drbd-reactor*
to monitor DRBD internal states and react on specific state changes to try and bring up
the **drbd-services@**__RESNAME__**.target**, starting with this unit and following
the dependency chain of services as specified in the corresponding
**drbd-reactor** **promoter** plugin configuration.

You typically should not use this unit directly.
