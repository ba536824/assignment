# debugger

This is a simple plugin that prints change events to stderr. This is mainly useful as a simple showcase for
users or plugin writers. It also helps developers to detect bugs in drbd-reactor's core.

Important: Messages are printed on debug level, so make sure to set an apropriate log level.
